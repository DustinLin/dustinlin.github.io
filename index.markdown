I'm a first year PhD student at Northeastern University, grateful to be advised by [Emanuele Viola](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/viola/). My interests lie in complexity theory, particularly pseudorandomness and the use of randomness in computation.

I completed my masters and undergrad at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), where I was advised by [Russell Impagliazzo](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~russell/). During my time at UCSD I was also very fortunate to have worked with [Nadia Heninger](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~nadiah/) and [Gerald Soosairaj](https://geraldsoosairaj.github.io/).


My master's thesis was a survey on the connections between randomness extractors and pseudorandom generators, and how they relate to optimal derandomization.

In my off-time I enjoy running, cycling, and swimming (occasionally putting the three together), as well as reading classics/philosophy. Any book recs are welcome.

Big shoutout to [Eugenie Lai](https://eugenielai.github.io/) for the website template and inspiration.

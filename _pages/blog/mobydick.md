# Moby Dick

A popular opinion is that it's a slog to read, and many drop it not far into the book. Wanting to confirm or dispel these rumours for myself, I definitely get the criticism that it can be a bit boring at times - especially when there are random chapters spread out describing whale anatomy (though it was interesting to read his thoughts on if whales should be considered as fish, or why sperm whales can't see directly in front of them). The highlights of this book for me were Ishmael's description of the sea (and his desire to head out to it), as well as the glory of whaling. 

Whales (and Moby Dick especially) are portrayed in almost a god-like/supernatural status due to their size and mysteries. It's interesting to think about how each of the diverse set of characters approach the activity of hunting whales. One thing I didn't expect though was how funny it was at times.

After finishing it, I conclude that it's still worth a read. And while you are at it, another great novel about a man and a fish is *The Old Man and the Sea* by Hemingway. While the book's premises at first seem similar, Captain Ahab and Santiago are far more different than alike.

You can read the book for free [here](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/herman-melville/moby-dick) courtesy of Standard Ebooks. (It doesn't seem like the Hemingway novel is there, but I managed to find it at a second-hand bookstore).

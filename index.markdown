I'm a first-year masters student at UCSD advised by [Russell Impagliazzo](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~russell/). I completed my undergrad at UCSD in 2022 with a BS in Computer Science. During that time I was very fortunate to have also worked with [Nadia Heninger](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~nadiah/) and [Gerald Soosai Raj](https://geraldsoosairaj.github.io/).

My interests lie in complexity theory, particularly pseudorandomness.

In my off-time I enjoy running, cycling, and swimming (occasionally putting the three together), as well as reading classics/philosophy. Any book recs are welcome.

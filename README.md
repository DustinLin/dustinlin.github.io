## Dustin notes, how things work

`jekyll serve` - launches the server at local host

`_layouts` folder contains how the html will be rendered with the content of the markdown inside. Basically need to have that setup so the styling will work correctly.

`_includes` folder contains some html that will be included in the default layout, basically for linking stylesheets and profile part

`index.markdown` - contains the actual word content, easily write and change in markdown.

`_pages` - folder that will contain future pages, leaving for now.

`docs` - folder that could include future papers, CV, etc

`assets` - folder for pictures?

I'm a recent grad working as a software engineer. This personal website was the remnants of my grad school days, but thought I'd keep it around. (Fingers crossed I remember to update the blog.)

In the not so distant past, I completed my masters and undergrad at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). Afterwards I was briefly a Ph.D. student at Northeastern University studying complexity theory. 

In my off-time I enjoy running, cycling, and swimming (occasionally putting the three together), as well as reading classics/philosophy. Any book recs are welcome.

Big shoutout to [Eugenie Lai](https://eugenielai.github.io/) for the website template and inspiration.

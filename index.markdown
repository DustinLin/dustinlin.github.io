I'm a first-year masters student at University of California, San Diego (UCSD) advised by [Russell Impagliazzo](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~russell/). I completed my undergrad at UCSD in 2022 with a BS in Computer Science. During that time I was very fortunate to have also worked with [Nadia Heninger](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~nadiah/) and [Gerald Soosai Raj](https://geraldsoosairaj.github.io/).

My interests lie in complexity theory, particularly pseudorandomness and the use of randomness in computation.

My master's thesis will be a survey on the connections between randomness extractors and pseudorandom generators, and how they relate to optimal derandomization.

Starting next fall I will be attending Northeastern University as a PhD student, where I will be advised by [Emanuele Viola](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/viola/).

## other
In my off-time I enjoy running, cycling, and swimming (occasionally putting the three together), as well as reading classics/philosophy. Any book recs are welcome.

Big shoutout to [Eugenie Lai](https://eugenielai.github.io/) for the website template and inspiration.

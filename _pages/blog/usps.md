# The USPS

Recently I've gone around collecting holiday cards/postcards to send to friends and family. What is perceived as a boomer ritual in the digital age I think is a great way to send something actually thoughtful this holiday season (instead of just buying random stuff online).

For only 73 cents you can send a message anywhere in the US; yes that includes Alaska, Hawaii, US territories, overseas US military bases, and even certain naval ships. Take a moment to think about how great of a deal that is! The postal service has been intertwined with the nation's history (and even before the "nation" existed), and despite all the hardships it has faced recently it still exists to serve everyone that choses and depends on it. I'd encourage everyone to go out, get a couple stamps and cards, perhaps relearn how to properly address mail, and drop it off at a blue box near you. Plus, there seems to be something special about a hand written note that a text message, email, or even phone call can't replicate.

# RIP kindle
Recently my Kindle Keyboard 3 which I have been using over a decade to read ebooks suddenly broke on me, and left me looking for a replacement. One obvious answer is to get a new kindle. Having used my kindle for over a decade, I was surprised at all the features (and many dollars attached) the new kindles have. However, I didn't really want to spend over $100 on a new kindle, and luckily I remembered I recent'y bought a used IPad...

The biggest turn-off for reading from an IPad that the non-e-ink-ness is harsher on the eyes. However, during graduate school I read/annotated many PDFs (see [this post](/blog/ipad.html)), and daily newspapers on the IPad. Having one device to use for all my readings would be convenient. Additionally, one pro of Apple Books is that it makes it easy to annotate (especially with an Apple Pencil).

Trying it out for a few weeks, using the dark mode settings offered in Apple Books, and dimming the brightness & night shift have helped make it easier on my eyes. Though it obviously doesn't replicate a e-ink screen, perhaps it's just something to get used to.

## misc
With my kindle, I would download ebooks ([shoutout Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)), and use [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) as my "digital library". Transferring ebooks to my kindle is as simple as connecting via usb. With an IPad using AirDrop or emailing books to myself accomplishes the same thing.

A note about physical books, one problem I have with them their size. Oftentimes I like to alternate between reading one fiction and one non-fiction book, and it can get annoying moving them around (Also they can get quite heavy to hold while reading!). Another is the ease of annotating on a digital device. My handwriting is messy and big, so writing in the margins of pages is difficult.

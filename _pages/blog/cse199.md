**Discalimer** I am referencing the UCSD course ["CSE 199: Independent Study"](https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/courses/course-descriptions/cse199-independent-study-undergraduates). A similar "course" may be available at other places, and what I have to say would be pretty applicable there too.

# A Spiel for CSE 199

great opportunity to explore research and topics

can choose what you want to do

build relationships with faculty, they get an opporunity totalk about what they like

basically free credits and course

easy to repeat (or noot repeat)

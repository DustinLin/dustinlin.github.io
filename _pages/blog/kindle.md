# RIP kindle
Recently my Kindle Keyboard 3 which I have been using over a decade to read ebooks suddenly broke on me, and left me looking for a replacement. One obvious answer is to get a new kindle. Having used my kindle for over a decade, I was surprised at all the features (and many dollars attached) the new kindles have. However, I didn't really want to spend over $100 on a new kindle, and luckily I remembered I recently bought a used IPad, which could be my new reading option.

My biggest concern reading from an IPad is that non-e-ink-ness is harsher on the eyes. However, during graduate school I read/annotated many PDFs (see [this post](/blog/ipad.html)), and daily newspapers on the IPad. Having one device to use for all my readings would be convenient. Additionally, one pro of Apple Books is that it makes it easy to annotate (especially with an Apple Pencil).

Trying the dark mode settings offered in Apple Books, and dimming the brightness & night shift have helped make it easier on my eyes. Though it obviously doesn't replicate a e-ink screen, perhaps it's just something to get used to.

TLDR: Give reading on the IPad a try, maybe it's not as bad as you think.

Also shoutout to [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/), and [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/). The former offers free ebooks, and the latter a "digital library" to organize them.

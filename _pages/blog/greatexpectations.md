Not sure why I haven't been doing this sooner - mini blurbs about books I recently read!

# Great Expectations

It was a great coming of age story that follows the main character Pip growing up and moving to London. There are many memorable characters and scenes, and interesting discussion/analysis regarding the original and revised ending of the book. I related to Pip's character development throughout the book and his perceptions about social class, family, and reputation.

I am no literary critic (clearly), but I think it's worth a read. You can red the book for free [here](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/charles-dickens/great-expectations) courtesy of Standard Ebooks!
